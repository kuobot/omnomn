  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ok, so I must have spent at least a good half hour this morning trying to figure out how to find out the dimensions of a goddamn rectangle in Photoshop.  That&#8217;s 30 minutes of my life which I will never get back, thanks to our designers starting out in Photoshop.</p>

<p>All I have to say to anyone who is building web products is this.  If you&#8217;re at all concerned with the costs incurred with designing and building an app, you should not start out in Photoshop. Especially when your operating in the lean agile modality.</p>

<p>So why do people still design web products using Photoshop? I have a number of theories. First, they are familiar with the tool. But these guys will eventually all die off, if they refuse to reinvent themselves.</p>

<p>Second, the over-emphasis placed upon optimization and creating super fancy images out the gate.  Sure, I readily admit these are nice and necessary at some point. I would argue that these don&#8217;t move the needle. Especially at the beginning.  Indeed, your precious resources are better spent buying plane tickets or starbucks lattes for potential users willing to give you feedback.</p>

<p>But enough of my rant.  So you don&#8217;t have to suffer as I did, here&#8217;s who I found the dimensions.</p>

<ol>
<li>Find the object you want by toggling the little eyeball in the layers panel.</li>
<li>Right click -> Convert to Smart Object</li>
<li>Cmd+C then Cmd+N to see the dimensions</li>
<li>Cmd+V if you want to paste to make sure you did it right.</li>
</ol>


<p>Enjoy!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Why it&#8217;s important to stay curious. Always be constantly asking ourselves is there a better way?</p>

<p>Rigidity comes with age. It takes the rare person to try out new tools.  And each year, the number in your age range drops. Guaranteed.</p>

<p>Eternal fountain of youth. Stay young, stay curious, stay hungry.  Don&#8217;t ever stop moving.</p>

<p>Observe kids.  They know no fear. They push boundaries. Most of us lose this as we become older. Being in the startup realm forces us to reinvent just about every single day.</p>

<p>Those who don&#8217;t bend, break.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I experienced Lyft for the very first time.</p>

<p>The pink-mustache touting vehicles had been roaming the streets of San Francisco for some time now. The great thing about living in the city is that invariably you&#8217;ll experience all which is new without having to make much effort. My coworker stopped by to show me on her iphone that her Lyft ride was coming in just 6 minutes.</p>

<p>Since it was going in the direction of my home, I immediately asked her if I could come along. Not too long after the scheduled time, a large black Audi wagon with a pink mustache came hurdling down Harrison. All of traffic was jammed up due to an Oracle conference at the Moscone center. The driver Peter gave us all fist bumps upon entering the vehicle.</p>

<p>All the while heading down towards Civic Center Peter, who looked to be in his mid-twenties, engaged in lively conversation. He told us about how he&#8217;d found Lyft and that it was the best part-time job one could have. His other gigs comprised largely of DJ&#8217;ing at various locales around the city. He got stares as though he were a celebrity rolling through town. And curious onlookers, mostly tourists, frequently stopped him to ask if this was some sort of cult, or a new hipster thing that he was a part of.</p>

<p>(contact Lyft for a story)</p>

<p>Lyft was primarly serving the local tech demographic crowd.</p>

<p>Filled the need for more transportation around town. Turned ordinary citizens into taxi drivers.</p>

<p>What are some other needs? Online marketing savviness. Unicorns. Developers. Where are there latencies and potential inefficiencies?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You know when you&#8217;ve internalized the startup process when you can&#8217;t help noticing that you&#8217;ve begun thinking of everything in terms of MVPs. Well, I&#8217;m here to tell you the same goes for epiphanies. Like the one I had this morning where I was on a cleaning frenzy in my 100-year old dusty apartment because Ben and I were trading places tonight. It was way past due for a cleaning anyway, with a dead bee crushed on the carpet next to my window. Yes, when you work for a startup, it&#8217;s much more efficient to batch things up this way. Like cleaning or doing laundry only when you discover you&#8217;re running out of underwear. Things your mother would never let you get away with. I&#8217;m working on a startup, you say. Oh, ok she responds. Yes another perk of working at startups.</p>

<p>But I digress.</p>

<p>The point I wanted to make here is after attending several lovely meetups here in the city, I recalibrated and course-corrected as any good captain of their ship ought to from time to time. Only time to time here in the warp speed of startup-land meant on a weekly, or bi-weekly basis.</p>

<p>It hit me this morning as I was passionately getting rid of all the dust bunnies on every single horizonal surface in my apartment. There are so many people and so many ways they were getting from here to there in building and creating and interacting with one another.  It&#8217;s as if you were in the middle of a desert, with zero transportation infrastructure, and all of a sudden you gave everyone a motorized vehicle. What happens? Everyone has their own path of getting from here to there. Granted, since they can see there are visual cues. For example, hand waving to let the other person go first. Now think for a minute what happens if you gave a magic blindfold to people where they were only able to see the other person if they happened to come within 10 feet of you.</p>

<p>Wait, this sucks, you say?</p>

<p>Welcome to the internet.</p>

<p>I was getting rather tired of making inane meetings with others. Not that they weren&#8217;t of any importance. Just that there were too many of them. It was enough to make the most seasoned extrovert exhausted at the end of the day.</p>

<p>As a result of meeting with my friend Jenn who had just gone though Y-Combinator yesterday, it hit me that I was looking for the wrong people. It wasn&#8217;t engineers and designers I was after. I needed to find architects, chief scientists, and artists. These are the ones who possess the raw material, the fuel of interesting projects. I could tell Jenn wasn&#8217;t entirely passionate about her current startup. It intrigued me.</p>

<p>Engineers and designers are second order after the architects, scientists, and artists. Everyone else falls into the 3rd order category of sales, ops, admin, marketing, self-proclaimed strategists, et cetera.</p>

<p>Now I know what you&#8217;re going to say next. But it is entirely possible to build a business based on second or even third order competencies. Of course this is possible. You can probably pick a mature industry and bring it down to its feet based of customer service alone. Which is the exciting part of living in this day and age.</p>

<p>But that&#8217;s not the type of project which gets my juices flowing. Just as you&#8217;re the only one who can define for yourself what success is, you&#8217;re also the only one who can decide which ideas and projects are the ones which you&#8217;re most truly madly deeply in love with.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I vividly remember the day I met the founder of my startup. I was like the little boy in Polar Express. The train had just stopped outside my window on Christmas Eve. &#8220;Welcome aboard!&#8221; he yelled. I didn&#8217;t care where we were going. I was simply estatic about being onboard. This was my chance at leaping headfirst into the startup world. It was now or never.</p>

<p>I lept. Little did I know it would be the ride of my life.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I overheard our head of sales say this out loud just last Friday.</p>

<p>I forget this sometimes. But it&#8217;s probably because I get lost in the trenches battling fires all day long. But how does one become Top Gun? The answer is the one who has all the fun is the one who makes up the rules of the game which everyone else plays by. It was getting tiring and I was exhausted at the end of every day. It was out of desperation that I picked up enough of Rails to be able to play. To sculpt. Little by little, I regained my strength.</p>

<p>Today I set goals. I shared them with others who I considered my strongest allies who were most likely to help in my endeavors. I made headway. Or at least, I felt as though I had. Which felt pretty darn good.</p>

<p>And I bought an electric guitar to help maintain my sanity.</p>

<p>Great balls of fire.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Phil Knight coined the phrase &#8220;Just do it&#8221;.</p>

<p>When I first started out, I was a total newbie. I had no idea what it took to build a startup. Sure, it&#8217;s easy. Everyone else is doing it. Boy, was I wrong. Nobody tells you to expect to fail 999 times before you hit it big. Why should they? No one wants to hear that plain ol&#8217; hard work wins out at the end. They all hear what they want to believe, which is that you work for a couple weeks and accidentally build a company that is worth a billion dollars. Erm, not exactly. The story is repeated often enough that eventually becomes truncated in order to boost the shock and awe factor. Don&#8217;t let this fool you.</p>

<p>According to XX startups are like the ricketiest roller coasters you&#8217;ll ever ride. That is 100% true. If the ride you&#8217;re on feels like Dumbo, you&#8217;re probably not doing the right things. Which means unless you&#8217;ve got deep pockets, chances are you&#8217;ll run out of money before you hit the gas pedal.</p>

<p>The weird part is, if you haven&#8217;t gone though it once before and &#8220;been there&#8221;, chances are you cannot possibly fathom what it takes to make it. In fact, the closest analogy I can think of is one where you&#8217;re running a marathon. Full of sprints.</p>

<p>Ben and I went to Six Flags Discovery Kingdom last weekend. We rode Superman.</p>
