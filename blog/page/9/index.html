  <div class="entry-content"><p>The great thing about working on the Internet is that you have trackability. You can think of it as Hansel and Gretal leaving behind breadcrumbs to find their way back home, except that in this case there are no cyber-crows sent by evil witches to eat up those breadcrumbs. Nay, instead you get beautiful data which you can crunch all day long using SQL queries to analyze where your traffic is coming from, and where you ought to be doubling down.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Programming is great in the sense that after you do it for awhile, you start to see the world in a funny logical way. I was introduced to Rails pretty late in my life but picked it up fairly rapidly, and because I have a natural tendency to draw analogies between totally disparate things, I came up with a few frameworks which I tested out and applied to life.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So in tandem with my picking up Rails, I was also starting to compile a list of potential projects I wanted to work on. I kept coming back to this one which I&#8217;d originally called Peoplequeue. Ben had already given up on it, advising me to read the Internet and essentially be a normal person. &#8220;Make something non-practical&#8221; was his advice. He was at the time working on a very ambitious project called Easel which aimed to re-invent the way the web was designed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I can&#8217;t remember when I was first introduced to these delectable little guys. It was love at first bite. Seriously. I could eat a whole bagful whilst programming furiously away. Tonight I decided to scour the internet to find where I could procure chocolate covered gummy bears&#8230; in bulk.</p>

<p>After searching high and low for about 30 minutes or so, I finally found what I decided was the <a href="http://www.nutsinbulk.com/milk-chocolate-gummy-bears-5-pounds.html?productid=milk-chocolate-gummy-bears-5-pounds&channelid=NEXTA&utm_source=CSEs&utm_medium=Nextag&utm_campaign=CSE">best price to least sketchiest vendor ratio</a>. I had to refrain from selecting the option for 25 pounds of chocolate covered gummy bears for $148.75. As I began checking out, I noticed a little countdown timer pop up in the lower right corner of the screen letting me know that if I checked out within the next five minutes, I would save an extra 5%. What a good idea for countering shopping cart abandonment, I thought.  Not that I would abandon my chocolate covered gummy bears.</p>

<p>One reviewer warned of high shipping charges. Hmm&#8230; perhaps I ought to buy more in that case, I thought. So you know those times you get stuck on the internet? Well, I&#8217;m having one of those moments right now. It became painfully obvious to me I wasn&#8217;t going to be making it out of here within the next five minutes.  I mean, here I am just innocently trying to buy a shitload ton of chocolate covered gummy bears, and I am waiting patiently for the shipping rates to appear so I can make an informed decision as to whether I ought to get the five pound package or the ten.  I almost gave up thinking the site was stuck. Finally, after 5 minutes of watching the brown spinner go round and round the charges showed up. FedEx was going to be $13 for 10 pounds and &#8230; (hrm, another 5 minutes, perhaps I ought to go take a shower while I wait). Ok, out of the shower and still waiting. I gave up and called it a night, and decided I would call them in the morning.</p>

<p>Three thoughts were running though my mind at this point: 1) seriously, how hard can it be to buy chocolate covered gummy bears?  2) perhaps I ought to wait until closer to Christmas to justify a larger purchase, and 3) if anyone within driving distance from the middle of SF wants in, <a href="joann.kuo@gmail.com">let me know</a>.</p>
