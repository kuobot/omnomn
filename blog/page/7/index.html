  <div class="entry-content"><p>So one of the lists I&#8217;m on is one I discovered a couple years back called <a href="www.betali.st">betalist</a>. It&#8217;s rather intruiguing to see what others are coming up with as it&#8217;s grown significantly since I first came across it. Although difficult to say how much of it is real versus wizard of oz beyond the splash page, it&#8217;s nice getting ambient information about what are the different types of things people are working on feeding straight into my mailbox.</p>

<p>There are so many smart people in this world.  It is both a blessing and a curse to be given the power to build anything you can think up.  So how do you pick which ideas to work on?  My advice would be to build that which is timeless. Of course, it depends on what type of person you are. Some folks look to capitalize on an emerging opportunity. My preference is not necessarily the same as yours, and certainly I&#8217;m not trying to impose mine unto you, but it is important to understand yourself.</p>

<p>Because if you chase after the wrong thing, even if you do attain it you will fail to achieve real happiness and fulfillment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong. Knowledge is nice. It is useful. But never, ever mistake it for wisdom.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s the difference, you ask? Knowledge changes. Wisdom never does. Back at Stanford, I vividly recall standing in the ME101 room in the Terman Engineering Room looking at a plaque on the wall engraved with a single quote by former professor of design Terry Winblad. It read:</p>

<p>&#8220;I chose to study people because human nature changes much more slowly than technology.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pace at which technology is changing today is fairly rapid. But if you take a look at humanity, all you see are constants. Sure, the way in which we communicate is fundamentally altered with social media and technology enabling interactions with others in different ways online. I would argue that technology is great for discovery purposes in that sense, but still there is no substitute for face to face interactions. So much is lost which is not captured, the facial expressions, the fact that the personality can be easily altered, just to name a few.</p>

<p>Technology ought to be used as an enhancement to our normal life, rather than a substitute for. The danger lies in using technology as a form of escapism, entering into a virtual reality sort of world.</p>

<p>So seek to learn and aquire knowledge, but always remember why you&#8217;re doing so &#8211; and don&#8217;t forsake wisdom in the process.</p>

<p><We Olive guy></p>

<p>Lets focus on what we&#8217;re doing now and make that bombproof. And for gods sake, come up with a design that is flexible enough to scale as we grow.</p>

<p>3 Customer calls today to collect add&#8217;l data points. As the calls progressed throughout the day I found myself forming the concept of what the dash ought to look like. Afterwards I took 10 minutes and drew up a quick sketch. We wanted to make it useful to our customers but there was so much &#8220;marketing&#8221; encompassed the challenge was to lay everything out and build it and build it quickly.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>No matter where you are in life, you can always give back.</p>

<p>And I don&#8217;t mean in monetary terms. Find someone to be a mentor for. If you feel like others can benefit from your learnings as an entrepreneur walking the oft-lonely path, it behooves you to find your younger self to befriend and assist.</p>

<p>It may surprise you to find that this can bring you even more intrinsic satisfaction than starting that mega-million dollar company. Don&#8217;t simply chase riches and forsake the rest in the process. I would strongly caution against this. Make room to find that balance.</p>

<p>This was actually one of the primary reasons for me writing these snippets. While I&#8217;m definitely not the smartest person in the room, if I can affect just a handful of people with my writings then I&#8217;ve succeeded. I was working at my startup helping small business owners during the day, and the experience was rather eye-opening. Technology is nice, but the interface and how you expose the information gathered is what ties it together and brings meaning to what it is you are attempting to offer. With that said, I do see a lot of companies giving lip service to the user&#8217;s experience and next proceed to put lipstick on the pig. I firmly believe that the evolutionary process applies to startups as well and as the market shakes the weaker experiences out, the strong will survive.</p>

<p>Remember in episode 3 of Indiana Jones, the greedy guy gets crushed as the building starts to crumble but he&#8217;s still looking for treasure? Don&#8217;t let that be you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The concept of luck first came to me when I read Lucky or Smart? by Bo Peabody. If you haven&#8217;t read it yet I highly recommend picking up a copy. A short 56 pages, but more potent than a lot of the long-winded stuff that&#8217;s out there.</p>

<p>Two key points really resonated with me. The first was he put it quite succinctly in terms of which ideas were the most powerful for him to work on. Those which were &#8220;fundamentally innovative, morally compelling, and philosophically positive&#8221;.  The second one was whether it was more important to be lucky or smart. His point being he admitted he thought of himself as lucky rather than smart as being the key contributor to his success as a young entreprenuer.  He went on to explain how he was in the right place, at the right time, with the right people.</p>

<p>So the key question is, what are the ways in which one could manufacture more instances of luck? If it&#8217;s all a numbers game, then it would seem to be a worthwhile effort to generate more of what one would consider &#8220;luck&#8221;.</p>

<p>How do you create &#8220;luck&#8221; for yourself?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wabi-sabi (佗寂?) represents a comprehensive Japanese world view or aesthetic centered on the acceptance of transience and imperfection. The aesthetic is sometimes described as one of beauty that is &#8220;imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete&#8221;.[1] It is a concept derived from the Buddhist teaching of the three marks of existence (三法印 sanbōin?), specifically impermanence (無常 mujō?), the other two being suffering (苦 ku?) and emptiness or absence of self-nature (空 kū?).</p>

<p>Characteristics of the wabi-sabi aesthetic include asymmetry, asperity (roughness or irregularity), simplicity, economy, austerity, modesty, intimacy and appreciation of the ingenuous integrity of natural objects and processes.</p>

<p>The concept bears many similarities to a startup endeavor. In the most difficult of times, where most people give up, if you remember one thing only: it&#8217;s the journey, not the destination. There is no guarantee that you&#8217;ll arrive. Only today is within your power. Make the most of it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Where possible, you want to demonstrate your ideas visually rather than simply telling them.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve seen this time and time again where it&#8217;s all talk and no action. Sure its great to bounce ideas around but real traction comes when you start getting those ideas out of your head and onto paper or even better yet, straight into an interactive prototype.</p>

<p>One night after a couple of Stoli with my coworkers Amy and David and David dropped me off back home, I sat down and slammed through the dash. I&#8217;d reached a breaking point. I&#8217;d had enough and figured I ought to do something about the current state of things, since engineering and supposed product wasn&#8217;t. It was a visually simple two pages linked together, the dashboard and connections. I sent it over to Kyle, our leading salesperson and certainly the most outspoken about product and asked him if he thought he could sell it and called it a night.</p>

<p>The morning after I got feedback from him that he loved it. I cc&#8217;d Ben to keep him in the loop.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If I could, I would stay in the land of minimally viable products.</p>

<p>This is where the fundamental direction is set. It is as a healthy infant child, or a block of plaster. Both are highly moldable. There is no political red-tape bullshit. All that comes later. Companies are a lot like people in that they too age. And become less fun and more rigid. Just look at Google. Game changers won&#8217;t touch it these days. My friends all left years ago to hop onto the facebook bandwagon back in 2009.  Those same friends left in 2011 to go on to the next big thing. By the time things blow up, you can rest assured all the best talent have already left the party.</p>

<p>But back to the MVP. This is the supreme and absolute intersection of where technology and art collide. It is making something that causes a pure techtonic shift in the way we work and play. It&#8217;s when you lay the groundwork and determine whether your little quake will be a 7.9 or a 3.2 on the Richter scale.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Good question. The answer is everywhere. And nowhere, at once.</p>

<p>They say ideas are a dime a dozen. Which is true. We can blue-sky dream about cool new products all day long. How many of them actually get implemented? Of those how many get implemented well?  The funnel starts to get real narrow.</p>

<p>Before embarking on a startup endeavor, I would urge you to think about how deeply you actually care about that idea you just came across. You can generally tell if you&#8217;ll have staying power if it&#8217;s all you think about day and night. If not, be careful. It might be a fly-by-night one night stand sort of thing. The fling is fun, but when the going gets tough you can rest assured chances are pretty high you&#8217;ll give up.</p>

<p>I mulled over my ideas for a long time. Probably too long. Only when I learned Rails did I get unstuck and unlocked the capability to build and play around with my crazy ideas. I was like a sculptor who had just been given a wet, delicious block of the finest clay in the world.</p>

<p>Ideas can come from a multitude of places. They can come from your observations of the world, of patterns you see. From other people. A combination of two seemingly disparate existing ideas. Throw in a bit of personality and you may have a winner. Remember Remy from Ratatouille, how he was creating flavor explosions in the mouth? Yes, great entrepreneurs are experimenting all the time.</p>
