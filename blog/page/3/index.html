  <div class="entry-content"><p>will come down to interaction design.</p>

<p>Today Ben and I collaborated on the new Locbox home page. I sourced a nice looking Spanish-woman Sunny was swooning over and sent it over to Ben. Not liking the ones I&#8217;d created, he threw it into a doc and within 2 minutes sent it back over to me. I added some catchy short copy. He gave me a few more tips which I incorporated and BOOM. Done.</p>

<p>I was staring at collaboration in the face.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It was only whilst in the middle of warfare that I could really comprehend the perils of outsourcing design.</p>

<p>There is marginally acceptable design and then there is design for optimization.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t confuse the two.</p>

<p>No startup needs the latter, but to disregard the former would be to walk into the jaws of peril as any pixels out of place make you look shady and leaves your potential customers suspicious about the quality of your offerings. Build quality, build fast. Use design sparingly and only when it matters. And no matter what, do not get carried away.</p>

<p>Make sure you build from the inside out. What this means is figure out your model and achieve product market fit before adding the icing on the cake. Make sure you&#8217;ve got a foundation before buying the furniture and going gangbusters decorating.</p>

<p>Why investors don&#8217;t look at the product, they only care about numbers.  Get the numbers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>7:35pm. Everyone has gone home. I&#8217;m still here. I didn&#8217;t finish my work until 7pm today and couldn&#8217;t wait to crack open TB to keep the momentum going.</p>

<p>I thought it odd for a startup to be empty after 6p. Surely this couldn&#8217;t be normal. I&#8217;d always envisioned startups to be where people hung out until late at night but apparently I was wrong.</p>

<p>Changed the reply from a button to a tear-off.  Like the sort you would see on the Stanford community wall where folks posted if they had something to sell, or was looking for, etc. The kind you&#8217;d browse if you weren&#8217;t terribly busy but perhaps waiting for someone in a lobby.</p>

<p>It was gnawing on me. If I built it, would they come? And how much of it depended on the experience since the actual necessity of this whole thing was tenuous to begin with?  I&#8217;d use it, but as I&#8217;d deemed earlier I&#8217;m not really in the mainstream. Question was how many others are there like me out there?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I told Ben I needed ideas to make money fast (auto glass, timing belts, dry eyes, now parking). I was watching money march out my door and I felt powerless to do anything about it. I begged him to help me think of ideas which did not involve robbing a bank.</p>

<p>He wanted to pivot Easel into a real estate website design company. I wasn&#8217;t so sure about that.</p>

<p>What Ben needed was to start a movement. Problem was, people like to have fun. And Ben and Matt are defintively not the most fun people in the world. They are way too serious. Sure there is a visual fashion trend going on which Ben is keenly aware of, but that was only half of it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Producer. Instigator. Creator. Artist. God.</p>

<ol>
<li>Fact: it is easier to become internet-famous than to become famous in ordinary life. Need to become internet-famous.  How to rise above the noise?  Writings and teachings.  Like Buddha.</li>
<li>You are on a mission. It is like being in space. Only you&#8217;re on the ground. Sort of like an invisible spaceship, that no one can see you building except for yourself.</li>
<li>You like ideas which are easily testable and which you deem would be &#8220;cool if it existed&#8221;</li>
<li>You like ideas which disrupt traditional structures.</li>
<li>You like participatory culture.</li>
<li>You like to make things happen.</li>
</ol>


<p>Objective: To create a platform where ordinary people can bring down the cost of advertising. Fans of brands. Target is large companies who pay traditional advertising firms an assload of money for that brilliant flash of insight which happens but no one knows when.  So they buy the whole lot. Seems inefficient, no?</p>

<p>Key assumptions:
1) The system can be designed where there is an equilibrium between the amount of work one has to put in and the amount of real or perceived reward one gets as a result of the effort.
2) Companies are willing to take it for a whirl.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Mindspace. You really have to be in it. Mulling over tb for more than several wks now, just have to get Ben to fix it so it can be live for testing.  He is moving tomorrow Castro and the weekend was already packed since I had to do Cardica works, but I moved it to the top of my priority list.</p>

<p>Stopped by ING to get a pumpkin latte and saw a sign for different orgs. Surely those orgs could have an email address associated with it and the subject line responses could be the title of the response. Would people use it?</p>

<p>When you&#8217;re working on something, it needs to become your heart and soul, your lover. You start thinking about it day and night, you lose sleep over it. But the beauty of it all is the cost of design build has come down to such a leven it is entirely possible that one individual, if they had strong enuogh desire, could very well go through and validate several of these ideas per year.</p>

<p>Think about it.</p>

<p>You become essentially like a mini-Google, throwing things up at the wall.  I was a naysayer for the longest time, saying ordinary folks don&#8217;t have enough resources to be like Google acting wily nily like that. But the time has come where I can&#8217;t really say it as loudly as I had been before, as I&#8217;d seen the future in what Ben was creating.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Emphasis.</p>

<p>I was staring at my application after my 3rd glass of red wine, hoping for one of those aha! moments to hit.</p>

<p>Sure, enough, one did. It suddenly occurred to me that the feed should be a true feed from my community irrespective of who was contributing at the moment. So the fact that the name was the first thing I saw actually distracted me from the thing which I wanted the user to focus most on, which was what was being asked rather than who was doing the asking. I wanted to calibrate everyone so that I treated each person the same, all people with whom I&#8217;d actually met before, and somewhat vetted as real live people.</p>

<p>I removed the name of the person from the first line and check it again. Well, there had to be some way of responding. So I added the person to the last 3rd piece of information behind the actual thing which was being discussed and the time at which it was posted and de-emphasized the size. So you could see who posted it, but it wasn&#8217;t distracting in any way. The end result? You treated everyone the same.</p>

<p>Boom.</p>
