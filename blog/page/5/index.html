  <div class="entry-content"><p>Easy on the eyes. If your users are going to be spending any significant amount of their lives inside your application, please have some respect for them and make it a positive experience. You can think about it as inviting someone into your home. Good hosts will pick up and tidy the place prior to guests arriving. The toilets will be clean, and dust bunnies eradicated from every inch of space visible to the naked eye.</p>

<p>To do anything less would be simply disrespectful.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The first thing you need to know about startups is that it ain&#8217;t easy.</p>

<p>But if you survive, you&#8217;ll only be stronger. Assuming you don&#8217;t lose complete faith in humanity after you discover things you might have rather not known.</p>

<p>The startup path is often times a lonely path. No one works harder than the founder.  The real test of your true commitment is whether you deviate from the path you originally embark on. It can be difficult to make the decision whether to keep trudging along or to &#8220;pivot&#8221; along the way, as it begs the question how do you know if you&#8217;re on the right track? And here the decisions you make tell a story in a very big way about how passionate you were about the original idea in the first place, or whether you were just trying to see if you could start a successful startup (which appears to be the trending norm, but I&#8217;ll leave whether that is right or wrong to another discussion at another time).</p>

<p>One Friday after a few of our tenents moved into our office space I met one girl who was doing a location-based mobile application for fashion. God only knows how many of those were out there. But being curious I looked it up and was duly impressed at the application, although it appeared to require much more work. Even more impressive was the story they told. It was basically an echo of what the rest of the fashion startup industry was talking about. But still, even though I had to remind myself of this, I spent the rest of the weekend wondering if that was a better way to go, but fortunately I ended up convincing myself that I should not be jealous of yet another stupid fashion application.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Removed photos b/c they were ruining my experience as the designer. Gravatars way too inconsistent. Screw this, I said, lets just remove them. I knew it was en vogue to be as visual as possible; however with the sample data I&#8217;d pre-loaded with actual users whom I knew, I wasn&#8217;t having a very good experience.</p>

<p>Unless I could control the quality of the photos taken (ie. they were all mug shots taken with precise constraints) the better option for right now was simply to remove the photos altogether.</p>

<p>I contemplated my belly button for a second. What would happen if I were to standardize all the photos? Say, everyone looked super professional, or everyone looked fun and interesting, etc.  You remove that competitive advantage, and there&#8217;s one less variable one is likely to be distracted by.</p>

<p>Another service that would be really interesting I just thought of (which I&#8217;d picked up and turned over before) would be a resume/career counseling service for job-seekers. Amy is going to one right now. How large is that market? And can a platform be created to help many vs the few it&#8217;s currently limited to?  What if everyone had really super awesome-looking resumes that made it easy on the recruiters by using best practices for everyone? No more bad resumes, there is no such thing. Only poorly presented ones.</p>

<p>What is the price of a career counselor?</p>

<p>Tangential mind-wandering. Jaunts along the way that you can spin off.  I&#8217;m an opportunist. It&#8217;s why whenever I see a sale I double-down. Ben makes fun of me for that. Hey man, I said, you&#8217;re lucky you&#8217;re dating an opportunist. Would you rather I go out and buy things full-price? He quickly backpedaled.  See? You just have to make them see the light.</p>
