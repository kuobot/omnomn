<div class="entry-content"><p>You know when you&#8217;ve internalized the startup process when you can&#8217;t help noticing that you&#8217;ve begun thinking of everything in terms of MVPs. Well, I&#8217;m here to tell you the same goes for epiphanies. Like the one I had this morning where I was on a cleaning frenzy in my 100-year old dusty apartment because Ben and I were trading places tonight. It was way past due for a cleaning anyway, with a dead bee crushed on the carpet next to my window. Yes, when you work for a startup, it&#8217;s much more efficient to batch things up this way. Like cleaning or doing laundry only when you discover you&#8217;re running out of underwear. Things your mother would never let you get away with. I&#8217;m working on a startup, you say. Oh, ok she responds. Yes another perk of working at startups.</p>

<p>But I digress.</p>

<p>The point I wanted to make here is after attending several lovely meetups here in the city, I recalibrated and course-corrected as any good captain of their ship ought to from time to time. Only time to time here in the warp speed of startup-land meant on a weekly, or bi-weekly basis.</p>

<p>It hit me this morning as I was passionately getting rid of all the dust bunnies on every single horizonal surface in my apartment. There are so many people and so many ways they were getting from here to there in building and creating and interacting with one another.  It&#8217;s as if you were in the middle of a desert, with zero transportation infrastructure, and all of a sudden you gave everyone a motorized vehicle. What happens? Everyone has their own path of getting from here to there. Granted, since they can see there are visual cues. For example, hand waving to let the other person go first. Now think for a minute what happens if you gave a magic blindfold to people where they were only able to see the other person if they happened to come within 10 feet of you.</p>

<p>Wait, this sucks, you say?</p>

<p>Welcome to the internet.</p>

<p>I was getting rather tired of making inane meetings with others. Not that they weren&#8217;t of any importance. Just that there were too many of them. It was enough to make the most seasoned extrovert exhausted at the end of the day.</p>

<p>As a result of meeting with my friend Jenn who had just gone though Y-Combinator yesterday, it hit me that I was looking for the wrong people. It wasn&#8217;t engineers and designers I was after. I needed to find architects, chief scientists, and artists. These are the ones who possess the raw material, the fuel of interesting projects. I could tell Jenn wasn&#8217;t entirely passionate about her current startup. It intrigued me.</p>

<p>Engineers and designers are second order after the architects, scientists, and artists. Everyone else falls into the 3rd order category of sales, ops, admin, marketing, self-proclaimed strategists, et cetera.</p>

<p>Now I know what you&#8217;re going to say next. But it is entirely possible to build a business based on second or even third order competencies. Of course this is possible. You can probably pick a mature industry and bring it down to its feet based of customer service alone. Which is the exciting part of living in this day and age.</p>

<p>But that&#8217;s not the type of project which gets my juices flowing. Just as you&#8217;re the only one who can define for yourself what success is, you&#8217;re also the only one who can decide which ideas and projects are the ones which you&#8217;re most truly madly deeply in love with.</p>
