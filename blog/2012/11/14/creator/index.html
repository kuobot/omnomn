<div class="entry-content"><p>Obj: To make the point that
1) There&#8217;s never been a greater time in history of mankind for the individual to achieve (history lesson)
2) Builders rule the world (the one w/ the code makes the rules)
3) How to start? (flexible, learn to surf, get the right tools)</p>

<p>Join a startup. Even if it fails, you have to remember #1 goal is to learn. If you are learning from the experience day in and day out, nothing is a loss. A startup is really about the journey (and to a lesser extent I would argue, the destination). One of the things I brought to my startup at the beginning was a naivete mind. Looking back, this was sort of a double-edged sword. Since I wasn&#8217;t encumbered by the &#8220;knowing way it should work&#8221;, this made me take a lot more of a beating than I probably should have had in working with small business owners. But it allowed me to learn on my own difficult lessons which are ingrained in my mind more deeply than it otherwise would be had I learned by hearing others&#8217; experiences. There is no substitute for being in the trenches.</p>

<p>Somehow, we made it to Series A.</p>

<p>I learned a lot of things this first year. For example, that I needed to have the ability to process information much faster. I was thrown in the deep end of the pool, drowning in a pool of emails.  I learned to set up filters. Before, I would deliberate on things for what seems now like ages. You might say I acquired an affinity for speed. I also learned to use the internet as a research tool. I learned to spy on competitors products. I learned to communicate better. I learned to organize my thoughts better. I learned that the sky&#8217;s the limit and that you wake up each morning asking, what should we build today? And then making it happen.</p>

<p>I learned to build a team.</p>

<p>Somewhere along the way, I came across a nascent product that promised to help me build better. It was called Easel, started by two young idealistic guys and funded by Y-Combinator.  It was an ambitious start to a project that promised to revolutionize the way web products were built. After I created my first few pages, I was hooked. My development team loved it. I was building in the browser, real time, and one could literally watch as the page got built. Hot damn. It was like magic. I can&#8217;t tell how I felt that I was watching man land on the moon when I used the bookmarklet to import the entire Basecamp calendar into my document. (It was for a concept, and I ended up creating my own just for the record).</p>

<p>I was like Mozart composing his Requiem.</p>
