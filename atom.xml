    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Executive decisions have to be made.  It was becoming increasingly apparent to me that unless I put Christmas tree into the weekly sprint it would never get done.</p>

<p>Attempt #1: Kyle and Andrew went with me to get it but the place we wanted to get it from didn&#8217;t have stands. And to get a stand would exceed our allocated bandwidth. So we went back empty-handed.</p>

<p>Attempt #2: Ronald and Keri and I went to Target to get a stand. We found ourselves staring at an empty shelf. They were out of stands. Foiled yet again.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It was the last day in November. We&#8217;d hit our numbers, and just launched mobile. I laid out the following plan for us (note: I left out the contractors) through the end of the year:</p>

<p>• General mktg (D)<br>
• Prod mktg (D,J)<br>
• PR tricks (J)<br>
• Product design (J, SM)<br>
• Engg build (J,B,K)<br>
• Data (K, SR)<br></p>

<p>Fires were being lit under each and every single one of our asses, and the team was being rallied to ask how can we do better? It was a rare day but the mood was very positive. But we all knew the road was still long with unforseen challenges.</p>

<p>It was a time for the company as a whole to level up.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>San Francisco is a sort of a microcosm in that people from all over the world flock here to &#8220;do the startup thing&#8221;.  Since moving here, I&#8217;ve met so many people who&#8217;ve traveled far and wide from Europe, Australia, the Midwest, China and more. Why? This is the place where magic happens. Perhaps if you come here, some of the magic will rub off on you too. It sort of reminds me of the time I was in Dubai, where there was no such thing as a shortage of land. They simply created it. Here in the Valley, there&#8217;s no shortage of ideas. You simply come up with more.  There&#8217;s no shame in trying and failing.</p>

<p>The real shame is in not trying at all.</p>

<p>This is what the New Web is all about. Less about what technology can do than what we can do using technology.  When you take a careful look, you realize that it&#8217;s not the idea that&#8217;s the important thing.  The idea is secondary.  The primary goal here is to simply making something happen.  Anything.</p>

<p>As long as we prove something of ourselves.</p>

<p>My college roommate gave me a framed quote from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe which stated “Whatever you can do, or dream you can do, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it. Begin it now.”</p>

<p>What the German novelist, dramatist, poet, humanist, scientist, and philosopher was the fundamental fuel of startups. The spirit of the times ignites within each and every one of us the urge to make some sort of impact upon the world. We live in a modern-day renaissance inciting passion and fervor and sense of urgency which is the most exciting thing about being alive.</p>

<p>Here and now.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In Los Angeles you hear people talking about blue jeans and sporting the latest fashionable large handbags and sunglasses.  Replace the celebrity gossip with excited exchanges on the latest idea, shiny new experiences, and plans to gain traction. San Francisco is quite similar to LA in the sense that both places have a fashion undercurrents in the air. You can&#8217;t see it, but you can definitely feel something amiss.</p>

<p>A few properties characterize the most successful startups as I&#8217;ve observed and experienced from the trenches.  Here they are, in no particular order:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Gone: Heavy spec writing.<br>
Instead: Lightweight specs and standups.</p></li>
<li><p>Gone: The unknown corporation.<br>
Instead: The personable touch.</p></li>
<li><p>Gone: Ignoring the customer.<br>
Instead: The customer is king.</p></li>
<li><p>Gone: Poor user experiences.<br>
Instead: Spotlight on the user experience. Whimsy, personality, fun. Character. This is why copyrighting is so important these days.</p></li>
<li><p>Gone: Just build it. <br>
Instead: Figure out what you will build and market and sell it first. Then build it.</p></li>
<li><p>Gone: Silos of demarcation.<br>
Instead: Integrated, small design-build teams who can turn on a dime.</p></li>
<li><p>Gone: Boring jobs.<br>
Instead: You can have your cake and eat it too.</p></li>
<li><p>Gone: The corporate zombie.<br>
Instead: The enlightened, self-motivated employee.</p></li>
<li><p>Gone: Playing by the rules.<br>
Intead: Making the rules. Or in some cases, breaking them first.</p></li>
<li><p>Gone: Believing you can&#8217;t.<br>
Instead: Believing you can.</p></li>
<li><p>Gone: Traditional models and institutions.<br>
Instead: Forging your own way.</p></li>
<li><p>Gone: Traditional glass ceilings.<br>
Instead: Fuck you money.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>These characteristics comprise the <a href="http://kuobot.github.com/omnomn/blog/2012/11/24/P_doing-the-startup-thing/">New Renaissance</a> and if you&#8217;ve ever been in the trenches yourself, then you&#8217;ll know what I&#8217;m talking about.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The concept of luck first came to me when I read Lucky or Smart? by Bo Peabody. If you haven&#8217;t read it yet I highly recommend picking up a copy. A short 56 pages, but more potent than a lot of the long-winded stuff that&#8217;s out there.</p>

<p>Two key points really resonated with me. The first was he put it quite succinctly in terms of which ideas were the most powerful for him to work on. Those which were &#8220;fundamentally innovative, morally compelling, and philosophically positive&#8221;.  The second one was whether it was more important to be lucky or smart. His point being he admitted he thought of himself as lucky rather than smart as being the key contributor to his success as a young entreprenuer.  He went on to explain how he was in the right place, at the right time, with the right people.</p>

<p>So the key question is, what are the ways in which one could manufacture more instances of luck? If it&#8217;s all a numbers game, then it would seem to be a worthwhile effort to generate more of what one would consider &#8220;luck&#8221;.</p>

<p>How do you create &#8220;luck&#8221; for yourself?</p>
